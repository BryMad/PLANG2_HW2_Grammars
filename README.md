# HW2 Problems to Turn In

## Problem 1
- grammars.ohm contains all grammars in ohm form.
- grammars_testform.js has all grammars formatted as raw text in a js file (in compatible form of Dr. Toal's provided test suite)(in case that's easier!).

## Problem 2
- problem2.ohm contains grammar for problem 2.
